Answers to some of the programming challenges in the Advent Of Code 2020 programming challenge.


        Run each day like, if in linux:

            chmod +x day1.go
            ./day1

        otherwise:

            go build -o day  day1.go
            ./day

        The Go compiler version I use is 1.15.8.
